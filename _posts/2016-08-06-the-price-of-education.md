The Price of Education

Pupils who go private get ahead by two years

[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/education/article4699991.ece][0]

Argument framed in wrong terms, misses the point.

End up saying advantage to money, enhancing inequality

Should be "why are state schools two years behind?"

2015 St Pauls 3 x £7500 = £22,000

2015 Govt spend on education = 89,000,000,000 for 3.95m kids from 2 to 18 = 22500 per pupil.

80,000 of above are under 5\. Best private Kindergarten =10k p/a
