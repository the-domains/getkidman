**The Price of Education**

> Pupils who go private get ahead by two years... [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/education/article4699991.ece][0]

The argument, regretably as always, is framed the in wrong terms.

Ends up effectively saying "advantage to money, inequality wins again"

If there's any financial inequality, the maths shows it's stacked up against a private educatio.

2015 St Pauls term fees were £7,500 or (3 x £7500 =) £22,000\.

2015 Govt spend on education was 89,000,000,000\.

The UK has 3.95m kids from 2 to 18\.

That's a cost of £22,500 per pupil.

The real question is, "If it costs the taxpayer £22,500 per year, per pupil on a state education (£500 more than a child at private school) - why are private school pupils two years ahead of state school pupils in their education?".

And I've been conservative in my figures.

80,000 of those 3.95m kids are under 5\.

512,000 of those kids are already in private school.

The most expensive private Kindergarten in the UK is £10,000 per year.
